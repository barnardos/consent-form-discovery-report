# User-testing with prototypes:
The clickable prototypes were tested with six users. We were looking for:

* validation of discovery use-cases
* usability findings
* feedback on language and content

Research was carried out with:

- 2 x Research Evaluation and Impact Team members
- 1 Participation lead
- 1 Marketing lead
- 2 x Policy workers

All insights were shared and collected on a [trello board](https://trello.com/b/Xq7VPkqJ/consent-form-usability-testing )

## Key commonalities between users:

- Users liked the automated pre-population of the consent form and information sheet
- Users did not find the flow of the form builder intuitive
- Users were unlikely to know who their research participants or participation attendees were ahead of time 

## Key differences

- Some users intuitively used the sidebar for navigation, others did not
- Not everyone using the form builder would see themselves as a researcher, so some found more 'researcher-y' language unclear
- Similarly, as some users will not necessarily see themselves as ‘doing research’ it is necessary to have a workflow that did not alienate them

## Some key quotes

> *"I don't know who my participants are"*

> *"At the first stage of consent I don’t know who anyone’s name is"*

> &"Use language for a 12-year-old"*

> *"This will print out a form? Great!"*

> *"We don’t do research"*
