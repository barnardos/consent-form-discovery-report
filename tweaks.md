#Tweaks

Tweaks	
Lots of things need small adjustments. This includes (but not limited to!):
Date on the consent form
More details for researchers & add more than 2 people
Want to edit the information sheet while seeing it ‘as is’
Add photos to recording methods
Give more detail on how and where data is stored and what the consent to it being used for
Next of kin details
Add incentive information to the info sheet
Make it clear you’re only building a consent form

Design decisions, research questions and icebox

Design decisions - overall flow
How do we make it explicitly clear what the tool is for vs. not for
We need to agree this, as well!
How do we do forwards, backwards, returning to edit and sidebar nav
What order do you enter information (title, description, participants)
How do we prompt people to enter title and description of a session in a ‘consenter’ friendly way
Where do big labels go e.g. ‘declaration of consent’ 
Function of labels - e.g. declaration of consent
What information is the minimum required
Should we be using mandatory fields

What is this tool for? If they don’t need consent how to stop them using it?
How much competence regarding Barnardo’s staff knowledge of consent are we assuming?
General project vs session and overall ‘IA’ of the builder?
Where do we add participants?
How do we both ask for and define nuanced consent
especially for data and media permissions
Design decisions - cont.

Ongoing Research Questions
Need to agree priority users and user journeys
What is and who is and who sees themselves as gatekeepers?
Need to map the consent process across the teams that are our priority users
When can a person consent (16+, depends on research, etc)
Can we do fully digital consent (wet signature vs tick box)
How do we do ‘other’ in a way which makes the tool more useful without making it too complex 
How do we use the consent builder to standardise and improve consent in Barnardo’s

Form-builder vs. how does Barnardo’s manage consent
In scope:
Make flow better
Consent and info sheet created before we know who the participants are 
Researcher vs non-researcher language - aka avoid jargon!
Make it explicitly clear to researchers to get info sheet to participants regardless of consent
Further research:
Processes differ across department  - What words mean whatDifferent ages and vulnerability of consent
What should the whole research journey be for Barnardo’s?
What’s the business case and potential audience
Open up the tool to other charities?
