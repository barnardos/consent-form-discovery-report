# Alpha changes

During Alpha, the key changes to the tool were in the following three categories:  

## 1. Copy

* Testing
* Validation with staff
* Used Hemingway app to ensure reading age is under 9 yearâ€™s old
* Different version of consent form copy

## 2. Form

* Added breadcrumbs as flow unclear
* Order wrong so did card sort with digital team (sheet in drive)
* Broke down whole information sheet into sections. 
* Distinguished between static and changeable content

## 3. Conceptual changes

* What is the consent age?
    * It depends - so we changed from an age based question to asking if they can give consent themselves
* What is the data policy?
* What is data storage?
    * There is currently no specific policy
* Participation VS research VS regions 
* Session details
