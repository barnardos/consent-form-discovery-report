# Background 

The team identified problems with Barnardo's processes for developing consent forms. These included the amount of time spent filling in forms, unfriendly language and the lack of an easy storage and management system.

A wider iteration of the tool is being scoped that takes into account wider organisational needs and the effect of changes under new EU regulations - the 	[General Data Protection Regulations](http://www.eugdpr.org/) - from Spring 2018.
