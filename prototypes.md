# Prototyping:
During the discovery phase, the team developed a range of prototypes that allowed it to:

* clarify emergent thinking;
* learn how to use new tools; and
* validate early ideas as to how the consent form builder might be built. 


### 1. Paper Prototypes

### 2. Clickable prototype
Using Marvel and Sketch tools, the team created a clickable low-fildelity prototype that was tested with users.

This type of prototype looks 'real', in that it consists of connected screens that you can navigate through by clicking icons and buttons.
