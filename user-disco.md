# Defining who our users are:

During discovery research was carried to define users. It was eventaully decided that it was most intuitive to define users by their roles in the organisation (e.g. a participation worker) than by their role in the recruitment process. Early research into types of users can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/QTNcy2kO/consent-form-builder-research-and-design)

Users were defined as follows:

### Primary internal users:
  - People in Barnardo’s doing research
  - Policy, REIT, digital
  - People in Barnardo’s doing ‘participation’

### Other internal users:
  - Fundraising (140 requested visits in 3 months) 
  - Marketing, media & comms

### External users
  - People taking part in research
  - People giving consent on behalf of a child or young person
